# zDL
---

zDL is a small framework that allows you to generate download links for the files placed on your server.
You just have to set downloads you want and get corresponding download links, zDL will manage your downloads.

## Requirements

- PHP version 5.4.0
- `.htaccess` support *(non-essential, but highly recommended)*

## Installation

1. Put the **zDL** folder anywhere in your website directory.
2. Include the **init** file where you want to generate downloads, like this: `require('path/to/zDL/init');`. *This file is a PHP file without extension. If it generates errors, manually add the extension to the file.*

That's all! Now you can generate your downloads. Read the API section to know how to do this.

## API reference

*Use these methods to configure and generate downloads in your code.*

*A zDL instance called `$zdl` is already created by including the init file. Use directly the methods on this object.*
